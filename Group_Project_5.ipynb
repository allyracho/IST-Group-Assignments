        "The group created a database for the National Football League, NFL. We as a team are fascinated with the NFL and felt that no database includes all the information we would like to analyze. This idea is unique because it will be a combination of data on player and team performance as well as the revenue intake. I will be looking at it from the perspective of a team owner and when showing statistics of players, it would be similar to showing how well an employee is performing or how marketable an item would be. A typical business day for the analyst would include taking statistics on previously played games, updating the database, and reporting any changes made. Through discussions and brainstorming, the group settled on five topics to include. The five are team, headcoach, highest-paid players, MVP winners, and quarterback rating. The team included a revenue table in one ER diagram but later removed it and added ticket and merchandise sales to the team table as we felt it consolidated the information. Our group researched the statistics to be included and ensured accuracy amongst all tables. Our ER diagram had numerous revisions included adding and removing tables and fixing relationships. After these changes, the group settled on our final ER diagram pictured below. "

        "Each table is set up for a different entity. The first table will show the highest paid player of each team. This will give insight into how long the highest paid players for each team will be around. The attributes of this entity are the player's name, team, date of birth, position, and net worth. A constraint will be the range of ages. The second table will be the QBR, total quarterback rating, for the starting quarterbacks on each team. The QBR is a measure out of 158.3 and takes into account metrics on passing plays than passer rating such as strength of opposition and the clutch factor. This will show how well the quarterbacks for each team is performing and how important they are for the team. The attributes will be player's name, team, completion percentage, and year. Within these attributes, there is constraints  on the years active (1990-2019). Our third table is dedicated towards the head coach of each team and how long they were hired for the team. Our group felt this was a good entity as it indicates how well the team has performed in the past and whether or not they kept the head coach. Attributes for the table include the name of coach, team coached, years present, and the number of wins. Constraints will be for the amount of years (1920-2019). The fourth table will be the name and age of the last ten most valuable player winners. This statistic will show whether the younger players are starting to overtake the older players as the best in the league. It will also show that the NFL favors offensive players more than defensive players. Name, age, position, and team are the attributes for this table. A constraint such as keeping the range of ages between (18-50) and only checking between the years (2009-2019). Our final table is dedicated towards the team with team name being the primary key. Our entities are: number of players, coach, location, number of wins, ticket sales, and merchandise sales. Originally the diagram included a revenue table, but after consideration, it was merged with the team table. The relationships are pictured above. Using these entities, attributes, and constraints our goals can hopefully be achieved and create a successful database for the user."
